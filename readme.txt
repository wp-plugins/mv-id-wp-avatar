Replaces images for identities handled by the Metaverse ID plugin with WordPress avatars if the identity name matches a WordPress username

== Description ==

Taking inspiration from the highly pluggable nature of WordPress, "MV-ID WP Avatar" is the first plugin to take advantage of filters in the "Metaverse ID" plugin.

"MV-ID WP Avatar" checks if a identity handled by the Metaverse ID plugin matches the name of a user in the WordPress install. If a match is found, the html output for the identity is modified to replace the identity image with that of the WordPress user avatar!

== Requirements ==

* [Metaverse ID](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/metaverse-id/)

== Installation ==

1. Ensure that [Metaverse ID](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/metaverse-id/) is installed and functioning.
1. Upload the `mv-id-wp-avatar` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== ChangeLog ==
* Initial release, verified compatiblity with WordPress 3.0
